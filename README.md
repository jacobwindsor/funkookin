> Project to help me learn functional programming in JS

Eventually this will be a recipe book type app but I'm really writing it to learn functional programming in JavaScript.
I'll be following Prof. Frisby's [mostly adequate guide to FP](https://drboolean.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide/), 
taking baby steps each time. Eventually, this will build up into a React app but I really want to understand the very
basics of FP so I'm going for the bare minimum of just this babel config.

### How to Install

```sh
$ npm install funkookin
```

Run one, or a combination of the following commands to lint and test your code:

```sh
$ npm run lint          # Lint the source code with ESLint
$ npm test              # Run unit tests with Mocha
$ npm run test:watch    # Run unit tests with Mocha, and watch files for changes
$ npm run test:cover    # Run unit tests with code coverage by Istanbul
```
